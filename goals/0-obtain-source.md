# Goal 0: Obtain the source code

Whenever working on any project, step 0 is typically to fork and clone the repository, and install the necessary tooling. To streamline this process, this project has provided your team with step-by-step instructions.

## About the application

The [web application](./apps/web-bootstrap) is from the Lobe team's [starter for web apps](https://github.com/lobe/web-bootstrap). The Lobe Web Bootstrap project takes the machine learning model created in Lobe, and adds it to a project that runs in the browser using [React](https://reactjs.org), [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).

## Generate the repository and obtain the source code

The starter repository (or repo) has been created as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). One member of your team will generate a repository from this template, while the remaining team members will fork it. All team members will clone the repository locally.

1. One team member: [generate the repository](https://github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fhack-workshop-lobe%2Fgenerate) by using the template. Your team can give the repository whatever name you like.

2. All other team members will [fork](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the new repository.

3. All team members will [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).

4. For all team members, after cloning the repository, open the local folder in your favorite code editor

## Congratulations!

Your team has successfully obtained the starter code and explored the codebase!
